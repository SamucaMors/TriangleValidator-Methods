# Triangle Validator - Methods

## Description
This project is a modular implementation of a triangle validator program. It refactors the basic version by introducing methods to improve code organization and readability.
The program checks if three sides can form a valid triangle based on the triangle inequality theorem, calculates its area using Heron's formula, and compares the areas of two triangles.

This is the second project in a series of three, showcasing an intermediate-level implementation with modular methods.
## Features
- Validates if the three sides can form a triangle.
- Calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula.
- Compares the areas of two triangles (Triangle X and Triangle Y) and determines which is larger.
- Refactored with modular methods for improved structure.
